Spacewalk was the upstream project to provide a Linux systems management
layer on which Red Hat Satellite was based, was based at least until RH
Satellite version 5. Newer versions are not anymore based on Spacewalk,
instead Satellite is a federation of several upstream open source
projects, including Katello, Foreman, Pulp, and Candlepin.

Some weeks ago, a friend asked me if I knew a Docker container image for
Satellite.  
I have not found any image. What I found was some Spacewalk images, but
sadly none of them worked for me.  
I decided to create an image for this purpose.

While developing the image, I found serious troubles to make it run with
systemd (I'm a fan of systemd, but not inside containers yet).  
The result was a semi functional working image. I said semi functional
because some Spacewalk features are not working (probably an issue with
systemd again).  
The main problem was that spacewalk-setup script starts and uses
systemd to configure the database and the other needed services, that's
OK in a VM but not in a container.  
So i needed to hack into postgres setup and start the services with the
typical `command --config-file file.conf` executed from supervisord as
Docker entrypoint.  
Currently there is an issue with `osa-dispatcher`, on which I can't
find a fix to make it run.

This image is primarily created just for test Spacewalk interface and be
more comfortable with it aka testing/development purposes, or just to
have fun hacking with Docker containers.

Now, I'm going to make a short description of what the Dockerfile makes
and then start the container.  
Have fun.

I used centos as image base for this PoC

    FROM centos:7 

Typical Maintainer line

    MAINTAINER Eduardo Gonzalez Gutierrez 

Add jpackage repo which provides Java packages for Linux

    COPY jpackage-generic.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/jpackage-generic.repo

Install EPEL and Spacewalk repositories, after install, clean all stored
cache to minimize image size

    RUN yum install -y http://yum.spacewalkproject.org/2.5/RHEL/7/x86_64/spacewalk-repo-2.5-3.el7.noarch.rpm   
           epel-release &&   
           yum clean all

Import Keys to allow installation from these repositories

    RUN rpm --import http://www.jpackage.org/jpackage.asc &&   
       rpm --import https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-7 &&   
       rpm --import http://yum.spacewalkproject.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-spacewalk-2015 &&   
       yum clean all

Install spacewalk and supervisord packages

    RUN yum -y install   
           spacewalk-setup-postgresql   
           spacewalk-postgresql   
           supervisor    
           yum clean all

Copy the example file used to sync spacewalk database in a later step

    COPY answerfile.txt /tmp/answerfile.txt

Open necessary ports

    EXPOSE 80 443 5222 68 69

Change to postgres user

    USER postgres

Initialize the database

    RUN /usr/bin/pg_ctl initdb  -D /var/lib/pgsql/data/

Create spacewalk database, user, role and create pltclu language

    RUN /usr/bin/pg_ctl start -D /var/lib/pgsql/data/  -w -t 300 &&   
        psql -c 'CREATE DATABASE spaceschema' &&   
        psql -c "CREATE USER spaceuser WITH PASSWORD 'spacepw'" &&   
        psql -c 'ALTER ROLE spaceuser SUPERUSER' &&   
        createlang pltclu spaceschema

Change to root user

    USER root

Start the database and execute spacewalk configuration script

    RUN su -c "/usr/bin/pg_ctl start -D /var/lib/pgsql/data/  -w -t 300" postgres &&   
       su -c "spacewalk-setup --answer-file=/tmp/answerfile.txt --skip-db-diskspace-check --skip-db-install" root ; exit 0

Copy supervisord configuration

    ADD supervisord.conf /etc/supervisord.d/supervisord.conf

Use supervisord command to start all services at container launch time

    ENTRYPOINT supervisord -c /etc/supervisord.d/supervisord.conf

You can check or download the source code at GitHub
<https://github.com/egonzalez90/docker-spacewalk>

I uploaded the image to DockerHub, which is auto-build from my GitHub
repository, you can find it with the following command.

    [egonzalez@localhost ~]$ docker search spacewalk

To start the container use the following command. If you don't have the
image locally, it will download the image from DockerHub

    [egonzalez@localhost ~]$ docker run -d --privileged=True egonzalez90/spacewalk
    Unable to find image 'egonzalez90/spacewalk:latest' locally
    Trying to pull repository docker.io/egonzalez90/spacewalk ...

Now you have the container running, check if all the ports are properly
exposed

    [egonzalez@localhost ~]$ docker ps --latest --format 'table {{.ID}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Ports}}'
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   PORTS
    ded4a8b7eb1e        egonzalez90/spacewalk   68-69/tcp, 80/tcp, 443/tcp, 5222/tcp

Get the container IP address in order to enter from a Web Browser

    [egonzalez@localhost ~]$ docker inspect ded4a8b7eb1e | egrep IPAddress
                "SecondaryIPAddresses": null,
                "IPAddress": "172.17.0.3",
                        "IPAddress": "172.17.0.3",

Open A browser and go to the container IP address, if you use HTTP, by
default it will redirect you to HTTPS.  
The container uses an auto-signed SSL certificate, you have to add an
exception in the Browser you use to allow connections to Spacewalk.  
Once in the Welcome page, create an Organization.

Now you are in Spacewalk and can play/test some features.

There is an issue I was not able to fix, so osa-dispatcher and some
other features will not work with this image.  
If someone can give me an input to fix the issue it will appreciated.

    [egonzalez@localhost ~]$ docker logs ded4a8b7eb1e | egrep FATAL
    2016-07-12 18:13:32,220 INFO gave up: osa-dispatcher entered FATAL state, too many start retries too quickly

Thanks for your time and hopes this image at least serves you to learn
and play with the interface.
