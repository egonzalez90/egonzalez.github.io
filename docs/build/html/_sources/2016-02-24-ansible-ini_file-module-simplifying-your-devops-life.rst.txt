Ansible INI file module, simplifying your DevOps life
=====================================================

If you don't read docs, one day you'll realize that your an idiot as i
am|was.

A few days back, I've realized that i was using wrong all Ansible
modules power since i started with it. What happened?

| Most of the time i use Ansible is related to OpenStack configuration
  jobs. Almost, all OpenStack projects use INI formatted files for their
  configuration files.
| When i started using Ansible, I searched on Google how to configure
  any kind of file with Ansible modules. Almost all blogs/forums that i
  saw, talked about lineinfile module. So i used these guidelines on my
  next few months, now i realize that i was using in the wrong way
  Ansible modules.

Ansible have a module called ini_file, you change values inside INI
formatted files in a easy way , you don't need to use complicated
regular expressions to change a value in a file.

Here you have ini_file module usage docs:
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/ini_file_module.html

We are going to change Neutron user password in his dump config file, so
we create a simple task on which we can see how ini_file module can be
used.

::

   - hosts: localhost
     tasks:
     - name: Change neutron user password
       ini_file:
         dest: ~/neutron.conf
         section: keystone_authtoken
         option: password
         value: 12345

Once the task has been applied, we can see how the values are applied in
a proper ini style.

::

   cat neutron.conf
   [keystone_authtoken]
   password = 12345

| How many times you need to make a change in an INI formatted
  configuration file with Ansible and used lineinfile module?
| If the answer is many times, it's OK, you are a dump like me.
