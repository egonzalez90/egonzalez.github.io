<meta name="description" content="Spacewalk was the upstream project to provide a Linux systems management layer on which Red Hat Satellite was based, was based at least until RH Satellite version 5. Newer versions are not anymore based on Spacewalk, instead Satellite is a federation of several upstream open source projects, including Katello, Foreman, Pulp, and Candlepin. Some weeks ago, a friend asked me if I knew a Docker container image for Satellite. I have not found any image. What I found was some Spacewalk images, but sadly none of them worked for me. I decided to create an image for this purpose. While developing the image, I found serious troubles to make it run with systemd (I’m a fan of systemd, but not inside containers yet). The result was a semi functional working image. I said semi functional because some Spacewalk features are not working (probably an issue with systemd again). The main problem was that spacewalk-setup script starts and uses systemd to configure the database and the other needed services, that’s OK in a VM but not in a container. So i needed to hack into postgres setup and start the services with the typical command --config-file file.conf executed from supervisord as Docker entrypoint. Currently there is an issue with osa-dispatcher, on which I can’t find a fix to make it run. This image is primarily created just for test Spacewalk interface and be more comfortable with it aka testing/development purposes, or just to have fun hacking with Docker containers.

<p>Now you have the container running, check if all the ports are properly exposed</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code>  [egonzalez@localhost ~]$ docker ps --latest --format 'table \t\t'
  CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   PORTS
  ded4a8b7eb1e        egonzalez90/spacewalk   68-69/tcp, 80/tcp, 443/tcp, 5222/tcp
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Get the container IP address in order to enter from a Web Browser</p>
<pre>
[egonzalez@localhost ~]$ docker inspect ded4a8b7eb1e | egrep IPAddress
            "SecondaryIPAddresses": null,
            "IPAddress": "172.17.0.3",
                    "IPAddress": "172.17.0.3",
</pre>
<p>Open A browser and go to the container IP address, if you use HTTP, by default it will redirect you to HTTPS.
The container uses an auto-signed SSL certificate, you have to add an exception in the Browser you use to allow connections to Spacewalk.
Once in the Welcome page, create an Organization.</p>

<p>Now you are in Spacewalk and can play/test some features.

<p>There is an issue I was not able to fix, so osa-dispatcher and some other features will not work with this image.
If someone can give me an input to fix the issue it will appreciated.</p>
<pre>
[egonzalez@localhost ~]$ docker logs ded4a8b7eb1e | egrep FATAL
2016-07-12 18:13:32,220 INFO gave up: osa-dispatcher entered FATAL state, too many start retries too quickly
</pre>

<p>Thanks for your time and hopes this image at least serves you to learn and play with the interface.</p>

<p>Regards, Eduardo Gonzalez</p>
