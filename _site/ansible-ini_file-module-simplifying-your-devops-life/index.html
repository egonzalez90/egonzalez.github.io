A few days back, I’ve realized that i was using wrong all Ansible modules power since i started with it. What happened? Most of the time i use Ansible is related to OpenStack configuration jobs. Almost, all OpenStack projects use INI formatted files for their configuration files. When i started using Ansible, I searched on Google how to configure any kind of file with Ansible modules. Almost all blogs/forums that i saw, talked about lineinfile module. So i used these guidelines on my next few months, now i realize that i was using in the wrong way Ansible modules. Ansible have a module called ini_file, you change values inside INI formatted files in a easy way , you don’t need to use complicated regular expressions to change a value in a file. Here you have ini_file module usage docs: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/ini_file_module.html We are going to change Neutron user password in his dump config file, so we create a simple task on which we can see how ini_file module can be used. - hosts: localhost tasks: - name: Change neutron user password ini_file: dest: ~/neutron.conf section: keystone_authtoken option: password value: 12345 Once the task has been applied, we can see how the values are applied in a proper ini style. cat neutron.conf [keystone_authtoken] password = 12345 How many times you need to make a change in an INI formatted configuration file with Ansible and used lineinfile module? If the answer is many times, it’s OK, you are a dump like me. Regards, Eduardo Gonzalez">

<p>A few days back, I’ve realized that i was using wrong all Ansible modules power since i started with it. What happened?</p>

<p>Most of the time i use Ansible is related to OpenStack configuration jobs. Almost, all OpenStack projects use INI formatted files for their configuration files.
When i started using Ansible, I searched on Google how to configure any kind of file with Ansible modules. Almost all blogs/forums that i saw, talked about lineinfile module. So i used these guidelines on my next few months, now i realize that i was using in the wrong way Ansible modules.</p>

<p>Ansible have a module called ini_file, you change values inside INI formatted files in a easy way , you don’t need to use complicated regular expressions to change a value in a file.</p>

<p>Here you have ini_file module usage docs: <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/ini_file_module.html" target="_blank">http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/ini_file_module.html</a></p>

<p>We are going to change Neutron user password in his dump config file, so we create a simple task on which we can see how ini_file module can be used.</p>
<pre>
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
  - name: Change neutron user password
    ini_file:
      dest: ~/neutron.conf
      section: keystone_authtoken
      option: password
      value: 12345
</pre>
<p>Once the task has been applied, we can see how the values are applied in a proper ini style.</p>
<pre>
cat neutron.conf
[keystone_authtoken]
password = 12345
</pre>
<p>How many times you need to make a change in an INI formatted configuration file with Ansible and used lineinfile module?
If the answer is many times, it’s OK, you are a dump like me.</p>
